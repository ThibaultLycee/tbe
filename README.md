# Text Based Editor

Text-based editor is a simple text editor written in Rust<https://www.rust-lang.org>

## Inspiration

Tbe was tremandously inspided by Vim<https://www.vim.org>

## Usage

For now, there are only a very restricted amount of working things, as it is still in devellopement, and only at it's beginning.

### Command mode

The command mode is the main mode for Tbe. As it is in Vim, it allows you to type in commands to quickly do stuff such as :
 - `:quit` or `:q` : used to quit Tbe

### Insert mode

This mode does nothing for now

### General

You can switch mode using these keys :
 - `Esc` allows you to go into COMMAND mode
 - `i` allows you to go into INSERT mode
